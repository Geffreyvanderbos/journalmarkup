# Journal Markup

The plaintext Journal Markup is written with the following requirements in mind:

- Meant to be used in mono-spaced, plain text.
- Superbly lightweight and easily adopted.
- Avoid excessive wrapping of words in symbols. 
- Use symbols found on any keyboard.
- Prioritize white space for structure and clarity.
- Legible in any text editor.
- No excessive use of lists. Limit ‘outliner’ tendencies.
- Provide clear context indicators for lengthy journals.
• Emphasize writing and note-taking.

==========
Main headings are underlined with equals(=) signs; write the date with = underneath to start a new journal entry.

Subheading
----------
Subheadings group sections of your entry. E.g., 'work' and 'private'. Subheadings are underlined with dashes.

Content starts immediately after the headings.

Notes & Lists
-------------
Write plaintext and per-line thoughts in your journal. Use line breaks, indentation, or lists to organize where you see fit.

Tasks
-----
Todos use Markdown-like syntax. See the table below.

Contexts
--------
To make things easy to find, I mark focus areas for notes and tasks with a plus (+) sign. This way, I can use the search function in any text editor. 
Similarly, I use the @-sign for people I often interact with. Occassionaly, I #-tag certain notes that don't fit an area or person, for the same reason.
