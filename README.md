# Journal Markup

The plaintext Journal Markup is written with the following requirements in mind:

- Meant to be used in mono-spaced, plain text.
- Superbly lightweight and easily adopted.
- Avoid excessive wrapping of words in symbols. 
- Use symbols found on any keyboard.
- Prioritize white space for structure and clarity.
- Legible in any text editor.
- No excessive use of lists. Limit ‘outliner’ tendencies.
- Provide clear context indicators for lengthy journals.
- Emphasize writing and note-taking.
