# PlainText Journaling Markup Language

Inspired by Jeff Huang's never-ending .txt file for productivity journaling ([link](https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/)) and influenced by Tony Stubblebine's "interstitial journaling," this language attempts to make plain text journaling clearer.

## Why?
I tried a similar approach to Jeff but found simple plain text lacking context. I've crafted a syntax that maintains ease while providing better organization of your journal.

What you can expect in this repository:
- **Syntax Instructions**: it's work in progress, with continuous improvements for user-friendliness.
- **Text Expander Tooling**: Future updates include text expander shortcuts.
- **Draft Python Script**: A basic script for terminal-based manipulation is open for exploration.

## Features
- Date formatting (e.g., 2023-11-14) underlined with equals(=) initiates a new entry.
- Subheadings underlined with dashes.
- Allows plaintext thoughts with flexible organization.
- Follows Markdown-like syntax for tasks; variations denoted by symbols (! for important, !! for critical).
- Supports simple tables for structured data.
- Special syntax for meeting details, attendees, goals, notes, and tasks.
- Uses plus (+) for marking focus areas, @-sign for people, and occasionally #-tags for notes.

Refer to syntax.txt for details.

## Design Principles
- Meant for mono-spaced, plain text.
- Superbly lightweight and easily adopted.
- Avoid symbol wrapping.
- Uses symbols on any keyboard.
- Prioritizes white space for structure and clarity.
- Legible in any text editor.
- Limits excessive use of lists to prevent 'outliner' tendencies.
- Provides clear context indicators for use in lengthy journals.
- Emphasizes writing and note-taking.
